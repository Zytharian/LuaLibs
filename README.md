# LuaLibs

### What is this repository for?

This repository contains Lua libraries written primarily for various of my projects. It currently contains the following:

1. Lua Class System
2. UnitTests

Note that the class system uses the UnitTests library to execute tests and the ModuleEnvUnpack script for instantiating the standard classes.

### How do I get set up?

These libraries assume you are using a vanilla Lua implementation and that the required scripts are in the same directory as the one requiring it. In this sense the repo's setup as it is will not work and the require() calls need to be slightly altered for your application.
